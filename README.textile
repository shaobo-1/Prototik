h2. Bringing Holo Theme to Android 1.X and 2.X

How to install ?

# Git clone in Eclipse

# Add HoloEverywhere to you project library (Properties//Android//Library//Add)

# I strongly recommand you to use the great ActionbarSherlock (www.actionbarsherlock.com)
I you decide that you don't need ActionbarSherlock, remove the .Sherlock themes in styles.xml

# Add: android:theme="@style/Theme.HoloEverywhereDark" in tour application manifest, you may also want to test Theme.HoloEverywhereLight or adding .Sherlock to create awesome apps.
